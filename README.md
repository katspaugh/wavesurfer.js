## New TypeScript version

wavesurfer.js v7 beta is a TypeScript rewrite of wavesurfer.js that brings several improvements:

 * Typed API for better development experience
 * Enhanced decoding and rendering performance
 * New and improved plugins

‚ÑπÔ∏è Looking for the old stable version? V6 is here: https://github.com/katspaugh/wavesurfer.js/tree/v6

---

Try it out:

```bash
npm install --save wavesurfer.js@beta
```
```js
import WaveSurfer from 'wavesurfer.js'
```

Alternatively, import it from a CDN as a ES6 module directly in the browser:

```html
<script type="module">
  import WaveSurfer from 'https://unpkg.com/wavesurfer.js@beta'

  const wavesurfer = WaveSurfer.create({ ... })
</script>
```

Or, as a UMD script tag which exports the library as a global `WaveSurfer` variable:
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/wavesurfer.js@beta/dist/wavesurfer.min.js"></script>
```

To import a plugin, e.g. the Timeline plugin:
```js
import Timeline from 'https://unpkg.com/wavesurfer.js@beta/dist/plugins/timeline.js'
```

TypeScript types are included in the package, so there's no need to install `@types/wavesurfer.js`.

See more [examples](https://wavesurfer.pages.dev/examples/).

## Documentation

See the documentation on wavesurfer.js [methods](https://wavesurfer-ts.pages.dev/docs/classes/wavesurfer.WaveSurfer), [options](https://wavesurfer-ts.pages.dev/docs/types/wavesurfer.WaveSurferOptions) and [events](https://wavesurfer-ts.pages.dev/docs/types/wavesurfer.WaveSurferEvents) on our website.

## Plugins

The "official" plugins have been completely rewritten and enhanced:

 * [Regions](https://wavesurfer.pages.dev/examples/#regions.js) ‚Äì visual overlays and markers for regions of audio
 * [Timeline](https://wavesurfer.pages.dev/examples/#timeline.js) ‚Äì displays notches and time labels below the waveform
 * [Minimap](https://wavesurfer.pages.dev/examples/#minimap.js) ‚Äì a small waveform that serves as a scrollbar for the main waveform
 * [Envelope](https://wavesurfer.pages.dev/examples/#envelope.js) ‚Äì a graphical interface to add fade-in and -out effects and control volume
 * [Record](https://wavesurfer.pages.dev/examples/#record.js) ‚Äì records audio from the microphone and renders a waveform
 * [Spectrogram](https://wavesurfer.pages.dev/examples/#spectrogram.js) ‚Äì visualization of an audio frequency spectrum

## CSS styling

wavesurfer.js v7 is rendered into a Shadow DOM tree. This isolates its CSS from the rest of the web page.
However, it's still possible to style various wavesurfer.js elements via CSS using the `::part()` pseudo-selector.
For example:

```css
#waveform ::part(cursor):before {
  content: 'üèÑ';
}
#waveform ::part(region) {
  font-family: fantasy;
}
```

You can see which elements you can style in the DOM inspector ‚Äì they will have a `part` attribute.
See [this example](https://wavesurfer.pages.dev/examples/#styling.js) for play around with styling.

## Upgrading from v6

Most options, events, and methods are similar to those in previous versions.

### Notable differences
 * The `backend` option is removed ‚Äì [HTML5 audio (or video) is the only playback mechanism](https://github.com/katspaugh/wavesurfer.js/discussions/2762#discussioncomment-5669347). However, you can still connect wavesurfer to Web Audio via `MediaElementSourceNode`. See this [example](https://wavesurfer.pages.dev/examples/#webaudio.js).
 * The Markers plugin is removed ‚Äì use the Regions plugin with just a `startTime`.
 * No Microphone plugn ‚Äì superseded by the new Record plugin with more features.
 * No Cursor and Playhead plugins yet ‚Äì to be done.

### Removed options
 * `backend`, `audioContext`, `closeAudioContext', 'audioScriptProcessor` ‚Äì there's no Web Audio backend, so no AudioContext
 * `autoCenterImmediately` ‚Äì `autoCenter` is now always immediate unless the audio is playing
 * `backgroundColor`, `hideCursor` ‚Äì this can be easily set via CSS
 * `mediaType`, `mediaControls` ‚Äì you should instead pass an entire media element in the `media` option. [Example](https://wavesurfer-js.org/examples/#video.js).
 * `partialRender` ‚Äì done by default
 * `pixelRatio` ‚Äì `window.devicePixelRatio` is used by default
 * `renderer` ‚Äì there's just one renderer for now, so no need for this option
 * `responsive` ‚Äì responsiveness is enabled by default
 * `scrollParent` ‚Äì the container will scroll if `minPxPerSec` is set to a higher value
 * `skipLength` ‚Äì there's no `skipForward` and `skipBackward` methods anymore
 * `splitChannelsOptions` ‚Äì you should now use `splitChannels` to pass the channel options. Pass `height: 0` to hide a channel. See [this example](https://wavesurfer-js.org/examples/#split-channels.js).
 * `xhr`, `drawingContextAttributes`, `maxCanvasWidth`, `forceDecode` ‚Äì removed to reduce code complexity

### Removed methods
 * `getFilters`, `setFilter` ‚Äì as there's no Web Audio "backend"
 * `drawBuffer` ‚Äì to redraw the waveform, use `setOptions` instead and pass new rendering options
 * `cancelAjax` ‚Äì ajax is replaced by `fetch`
 * `loadBlob` ‚Äì use `URL.createObjectURL()` to convert a blob to a URL and call `load(url)` instead
 * `skipForward`, `skipBackward`, `setPlayEnd` ‚Äì can be implemented using `setTime(time)`
 * `exportPCM` is renamed to `getDecodedData` and doesn't take any params
 * `toggleMute` is now called `setMuted(true | false)`
 * `setHeight`, `setWaveColor`, `setCursorColor`, etc. ‚Äì use `setOptions` with the corresponding params instead. E.g., `wavesurfer.setOptions({ height: 300, waveColor: '#abc' })`

See the complete [documentation of the new API](https://wavesurfer-ts.pages.dev/docs/modules/wavesurfer).

## Questions

Have a question about integrating wavesurfer.js on your website? Feel free to ask in our [Discussions forum](https://github.com/wavesurfer-js/wavesurfer.js/discussions/categories/q-a).

### FAQ

* **Q**: Does wavesurfer support large files?
* **A**: Since wavesurfer decodes audio entirely in the browser, large files may fail to decode due to memory constrains. We recommend using pre-decoded peaks for large files (see [this example](https://wavesurfer-js.org/examples/#predecoded.js)). You can use a tool like [bbc/audiowaveform](https://github.com/bbc/audiowaveform) to generate peaks.

## Development

To get started with development, follow these steps:

 1. Install dev dependencies:

```
yarn
```

 2. Start the TypeScript compiler in watch mode and launch an HTTP server:

```
yarn start
```

This command will open http://localhost:9090 in your browser with live reload, allowing you to see the changes as you develop.

## Tests

The tests are written in the Cypress framework. They are a mix of e2e and visual regression tests.
To run the test suite locally:

```
yarn cypress
```
