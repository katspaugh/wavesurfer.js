wavesurfer.js
=============

Interactive navigable audio visualization using
[WebAudio](https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/audio/raw-file/tip/webaudio/specification.html) and Canvas.

API in examples
===============

Create an instance:

    var wavesurfer = Object.create(WaveSurfer);

Initialize it with a container element (plus some options):

    wavesurfer.init({
        container: '#wave',
        waveColor: 'violet',
        progressColor: 'purple'
    });

Subscribe to some events:

    wavesurfer.on('ready', function () {
        wavesurfer.play();
    });

Load an audio file from a URL:

    wavesurfer.load('example/media/demo.wav');

Or visualize your audio files via drag'n'drop:

    wavesurfer.bindDragNDrop(document.body);

See the example code [here](https://github.com/katspaugh/wavesurfer.js/blob/master/example/main.js).

Options
=======

  * `container` – CSS-selector or HTML-element where the waveform should be drawn. This is the only required parameter.
  * `height` – the height of the waveform. `128` by default.
  * `skipLength` – number of seconds to skip with the `skipForward()` and `skipBackward()` methods (`2` by default).
  * `minPxPerSec` – minimum number of pixels per second of audio (`1` by default).
  * `fillParent` – whether to fill the entire container or draw only according to `minPxPerSec` (`true` by default).
  * `scrollParent` – whether to scroll the container with a lengthy waveform. Otherwise the waveform is shrinked to container width (see `fillParent`).
  * `normalize` – if `true`, normalize by the maximum peak instead of 1.0 (`false` by default).
  * `pixelRatio` – equals `window.devicePixelRatio` by default, but you can set it to `1` for faster rendering.
  * `audioContext` – use your own previously initialized `AudioContext` or leave blank.
  * `cursorWidth` – 1 px by default.
  * `markerWidth` – 1 px by default.
  * `waveColor` – the fill color of the waveform after the cursor.
  * `progressColor` – the fill color of the part of the waveform behind the cursor.
  * `cursorColor` – the fill color of the cursor indicating the playhead position.
  * `loopSelection` – if `true`, playback will loop inside the selected region
  (`false` by default).

Methods
=======

All methods are intentionally public, but the most readily available are the following:

 * `init(params)` – initializes with the options listed above.
 * `on(eventName, callback)` – subscribes to an event.
 * `load(url)` – loads an audio from URL via XHR.
 * `play()` – starts playback from the current position.
 * `pause()` – stops playback.
 * `playPause()` – plays if paused, pauses if playing.
 * `stop()` – stops and goes to the beginning.
 * `skipForward()`
 * `skipBackward()`
 * `skip(offset)` – skips a number of seconds from the current position (use a negative value to go backwards).
 * `setVolume(newVolume)` – sets the playback volume to a new value (use a floating point value between 0 and 1, 0 being no volume and 1 being full volume).
 * `toggleMute()` – toggles the volume on and off.
 * `mark(options)` – creates a visual marker on the waveform. Options are `id` (random if not set), `position` (in seconds), `color` and `width` (defaults to the global option `markerWidth`). Returns a marker object which you can update later (`marker.update(options)`).
 * `clearMarks()` – removes all markers.
 * `bindDragNDrop([dropTarget])` – starts listening to drag'n'drop on an element. The default element is `document`. Loads the dropped audio.
 * `empty()` – clears the waveform as if a zero-length audio is loaded.
 * `destroy()` – removes events, elements and disconnects WebAudio nodes.
 * `loadDecodedBuffer(buffer)` – loads a decoded audio buffer (a typed array, basically).
 * `loadArrayBuffer(blob)` – loads audio data from a Blob or File object.
 * `toggleLoopSelection()` – toggles whether playback should loop inside the
 selection.
 * `getSelection()` – returns an object representing the current selection. This
 object will have the following keys: `startPercentage` (float between 0 and 1),
 `startPosition` (in seconds), `endPercentage` (float between 0 and 1) and
 `endPosition` (in seconds). Returns `null` if no selection is present.

Connecting filters
==================
You can insert your own WebAudio nodes into the graph using the method `setFilter`. Example:

    var lowpass = wavesurfer.backend.ac.createBiquadFilter();
    wavesurfer.backend.setFilter(lowpass);

Events
======

You can listen to the following events:

 * `ready` – when audio is loaded, decoded and the waveform drawn.
 * `loading` – fires continuously when loading via XHR or drag'n'drop. Callback recieves loading progress in percents (from 0 to 100) and the event target.
 * `seek` – on seeking.
 * `play` – when it starts playing.
 * `finish` – when it finishes playing.
 * `progress` – fires continuously during playback.
 * `mark` – when a mark is reached. Passes the mark object.
 * `error` – on error, passes an error message.

Each of mark objects also fire the event `reached` when played over.
