# wavesurfer-js.org

This branch contains the content of the website at https://wavesurfer-js.org.

## Update website

After a new release of wavesurfer.js is available on `npm`, the website needs to be updated as well.

Make sure you're on the `gh-pages` branch of the repository:


```console
git checkout gh-pages
```

And update the npm dependencies (inc. the wavesurfer.js library):

```console
npm update
npm install
```

Next, update the website content with this command:

```console
npm run update
```

This command:

- downloads and unzips the latest wavesurfer.js release to a temporary directory
- generates the latest API docs
- copies and syncs the files in this repository
- injects the unpkg CDN url in the `example` directory
- regenerates the `example` index page

Finally: don't forget to commit and push these changes in order to update the website.

```console
git commit -am "update for wavesurfer.js x.x.x"
git push
```
