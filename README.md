‚ÑπÔ∏è Looking for the old stable version? V6 is here: https://github.com/katspaugh/wavesurfer.js/tree/v6

---

## Getting started

Install and import the package:

```bash
npm install --save wavesurfer.js
```
```js
import WaveSurfer from 'wavesurfer.js'
```

Alternatively, insert a UMD script tag which exports the library as a global `WaveSurfer` variable:
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/wavesurfer.js@7/dist/wavesurfer.min.js"></script>
```

Create a wavesurfer instance and pass various [options](#wavesurfer-options):
```js
const wavesurfer = WaveSurfer.create({
  container: '#waveform',
  waveColor: '#4F4A85',
  progressColor: '#383351',
  url: '/audio.mp3',
})
```

To import one of the plugins, e.g. the [Regions plugin](https://wavesurfer-js.org/examples/#regions.js):
```js
import Regions from 'wavesurfer.js/dist/plugins/regions.js'
```

Or as a script tag:
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/wavesurfer.js@7/dist/plugins/regions.min.js"></script>
```

TypeScript types are included in the package, so there's no need to install `@types/wavesurfer.js`.

See more [examples](https://wavesurfer-js.org/examples).

## API reference

See the documentation on wavesurfer [methods](http://wavesurfer-js.org/docs/methods), [options](http://wavesurfer-js.org/docs/options) and [events](http://wavesurfer-js.org/docs/events).

### Wavesurfer options
- `container`: `HTMLElement | string` - Required: an HTML element or selector where the waveform will be rendered.
- `height`: `number | 'auto'` - The height of the waveform in pixels, or "auto" to fill the container height
- `waveColor`: `string | string[] | CanvasGradient` - The color of the waveform
- `progressColor`: `string | string[] | CanvasGradient` - The color of the progress mask
- `cursorColor`: `string` - The color of the playpack cursor
- `cursorWidth`: `number` - The cursor width
- `barWidth`: `number` - Render the waveform with bars like this: ‚ñÅ ‚ñÇ ‚ñá ‚ñÉ ‚ñÖ ‚ñÇ
- `barGap`: `number` - Spacing between bars in pixels
- `barRadius`: `number` - Rounded borders for bars
- `barHeight`: `number` - A vertical scaling factor for the waveform
- `barAlign`: `'top' | 'bottom'` - Vertical bar alignment
- `minPxPerSec`: `number` - Minimum pixels per second of audio (i.e. zoom level)
- `fillParent`: `boolean` - Stretch the waveform to fill the container, true by default
- `url`: `string` - Audio URL
- `peaks`: `Array<Float32Array | number[]>` - Pre-computed audio data
- `duration`: `number` - Pre-computed duration
- `media`: `HTMLMediaElement` - Use an existing media element instead of creating one
- `autoplay`: `boolean` - Play the audio on load
- `interact`: `boolean` - Pass false to disable clicks on the waveform
- `hideScrollbar`: `boolean` - Hide the scrollbar
- `audioRate`: `number` - Audio rate
- `autoScroll`: `boolean` - Automatically scroll the container to keep the current position in viewport
- `autoCenter`: `boolean` - If autoScroll is enabled, keep the cursor in the center of the waveform during playback
- `sampleRate`: `number` - Decoding sample rate. Doesn't affect the playback. Defaults to 8000
- `splitChannels`: `WaveSurferOptions[]` - Render each audio channel as a separate waveform
- `normalize`: `boolean` - Stretch the waveform to the full height
- `plugins`: `GenericPlugin[]` - The list of plugins to initialize on start
- `renderFunction`: `(peaks: Array<Float32Array | number[]>, ctx: CanvasRenderingContext2D) => void` - Custom render function
- `fetchParams`: `RequestInit` - Options to pass to the fetch method

### Wavesurfer events
- `load`: `[url: string]` - When audio starts loading
- `decode`: `[duration: number]` - When the audio has been decoded
- `ready`: `[duration: number]` - When the audio is both decoded and can play
- `redraw`: `[]` - When a waveform is drawn
- `play`: `[]` - When the audio starts playing
- `pause`: `[]` - When the audio pauses
- `finish`: `[]` - When the audio finishes playing
- `timeupdate`: `[currentTime: number]` - On audio position change, fires continuously during playback
- `audioprocess`: `[currentTime: number]` - An alias of timeupdate but only when the audio is playing
- `seeking`: `[currentTime: number]` - When the user seeks to a new position
- `interaction`: `[newTime: number]` - When the user interacts with the waveform (i.g. clicks or drags on it)
- `click`: `[relativeX: number]` - When the user clicks on the waveform
- `drag`: `[relativeX: number]` - When the user drags the cursor
- `scroll`: `[visibleStartTime: number, visibleEndTime: number]` - When the waveform is scrolled (panned)
- `zoom`: `[minPxPerSec: number]` - When the zoom level changes
- `destroy`: `[]` - Just before the waveform is destroyed so you can clean up your events

## Plugins

The "official" plugins have been completely rewritten and enhanced:

 * [Regions](https://wavesurfer-js.org/examples/#regions.js) ‚Äì visual overlays and markers for regions of audio
 * [Timeline](https://wavesurfer-js.org/examples/#timeline.js) ‚Äì displays notches and time labels below the waveform
 * [Minimap](https://wavesurfer-js.org/examples/#minimap.js) ‚Äì a small waveform that serves as a scrollbar for the main waveform
 * [Envelope](https://wavesurfer-js.org/examples/#envelope.js) ‚Äì a graphical interface to add fade-in and -out effects and control volume
 * [Record](https://wavesurfer-js.org/examples/#record.js) ‚Äì records audio from the microphone and renders a waveform
 * [Spectrogram](https://wavesurfer-js.org/examples/#spectrogram.js) ‚Äì visualization of an audio frequency spectrum (written by @akreal)
  * [Hover](https://wavesurfer-js.org/examples/#hover.js) ‚Äì shows a vertical line and timestmap on waveform hover

## CSS styling

wavesurfer.js v7 is rendered into a Shadow DOM tree. This isolates its CSS from the rest of the web page.
However, it's still possible to style various wavesurfer.js elements with CSS via the `::part()` pseudo-selector.
For example:

```css
#waveform ::part(cursor):before {
  content: 'üèÑ';
}
#waveform ::part(region) {
  font-family: fantasy;
}
```

You can see which elements you can style in the DOM inspector ‚Äì they will have a `part` attribute.
See [this example](https://wavesurfer-js.org/examples/#styling.js) for play around with styling.

## Upgrading from v6

Most options, events, and methods are similar to those in previous versions.

### Notable differences
 * The `backend` option is removed ‚Äì [HTML5 audio (or video) is the only playback mechanism](https://github.com/katspaugh/wavesurfer.js/discussions/2762#discussioncomment-5669347). However, you can still connect wavesurfer to Web Audio via `MediaElementSourceNode`. See this [example](https://wavesurfer-js.org/examples/#webaudio.js).
 * The Markers plugin is removed ‚Äì you should use the Regions plugin with just a `startTime`.
 * No Microphone plugin ‚Äì superseded by the new Record plugin with more features.
 * The Cursor plugin is replaced by the Hover plugin.

### Removed options
 * `backend`, `audioContext`, `closeAudioContext`, `audioScriptProcessor` ‚Äì there's no Web Audio backend, so no AudioContext
 * `autoCenterImmediately` ‚Äì `autoCenter` is now always immediate unless the audio is playing
 * `backgroundColor`, `hideCursor` ‚Äì this can be easily set via CSS
 * `mediaType`, `mediaControls` ‚Äì you should instead pass an entire media element in the `media` option. [Example](https://wavesurfer-js.org/examples/#video.js).
 * `partialRender` ‚Äì done by default
 * `pixelRatio` ‚Äì `window.devicePixelRatio` is used by default
 * `renderer` ‚Äì there's just one renderer for now, so no need for this option
 * `responsive` ‚Äì responsiveness is enabled by default
 * `scrollParent` ‚Äì the container will scroll if `minPxPerSec` is set to a higher value
 * `skipLength` ‚Äì there's no `skipForward` and `skipBackward` methods anymore
 * `splitChannelsOptions` ‚Äì you should now use `splitChannels` to pass the channel options. Pass `height: 0` to hide a channel. See [this example](https://wavesurfer-js.org/examples/#split-channels.js).
 * `drawingContextAttributes`, `maxCanvasWidth`, `forceDecode` ‚Äì removed to reduce code complexity
 * `xhr` - please use `fetchParams` instead
 * `barMinHeight` - the minimum bar height is now 1 pixel by default

### Removed methods
 * `getFilters`, `setFilter` ‚Äì as there's no Web Audio "backend"
 * `drawBuffer` ‚Äì to redraw the waveform, use `setOptions` instead and pass new rendering options
 * `cancelAjax` ‚Äì you can pass an [AbortSignal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal) in `fetchParams`
 * `loadBlob` ‚Äì use `URL.createObjectURL()` to convert a blob to a URL and call `load(url)` instead
 * `skipForward`, `skipBackward`, `setPlayEnd` ‚Äì can be implemented using `setTime(time)`
 * `exportPCM` is replaced with `getDecodedData` that returns a decoded audio buffer
 * `toggleMute` is now called `setMuted(true | false)`
 * `setHeight`, `setWaveColor`, `setCursorColor`, etc. ‚Äì use `setOptions` with the corresponding params instead. E.g., `wavesurfer.setOptions({ height: 300, waveColor: '#abc' })`

See the complete [documentation of the new API](http://wavesurfer-js.org/docs).

## Questions

Have a question about integrating wavesurfer.js on your website? Feel free to ask in our [Discussions forum](https://github.com/wavesurfer-js/wavesurfer.js/discussions/categories/q-a).

### FAQ

* **Q**: Does wavesurfer support large files?
* **A**: Since wavesurfer decodes audio entirely in the browser using Web Audio, large clips may fail to decode due to memory constraints. We recommend using pre-decoded peaks for large files (see [this example](https://wavesurfer-js.org/examples/#predecoded.js)). You can use a tool like [bbc/audiowaveform](https://github.com/bbc/audiowaveform) to generate peaks.

---

* **Q**: What about streaming audio?
* **A**: Streaming isn't supported because wavesurfer needs to download the entire audio file to decode and render it.

---

* **Q**: There is a mismatch between my audio and the waveform.
* **A**: If you're using a VBR (variable bit rate) mp3 file, there might be a mismatch between the audio and the waveform. This can be fixed by converting your file to CBR (constant bit rate). See [this issue](https://github.com/katspaugh/wavesurfer.js/issues/2890#issuecomment-1601067822) for details.
