  <h1>FAQ</h1>

  <h2>Can the audio start playing before the waveform is drawn?</h2>

  <p>Yes, if you use the <code>backend: 'MediaElement'</code> option. See here: <a href="http://wavesurfer-js.org/example/audio-element/">http://wavesurfer-js.org/example/audio-element/</a>. The audio will start playing as you press play. A thin line will be displayed until the whole audio file is downloaded and decoded to draw the waveform.</p>


  <h2>Can drawing be done as file loads?</h2>

  <p>No. Web Audio needs the whole file to decode it in the browser. You can however load pre-decoded waveform data to draw the waveform immediately. <a href="/example/audio-element/">See here</a> (the "Pre-recoded Peaks" section).</p>

  <h2>Can I make the audio start playing automatically on iOS?</h2>

  <p>Nope. It's a known issue that iOS won't allow you to play the audio programmatically. It won't play unless the user clicks on the page. It's a power/bandwidth-saving feature of iOS Safari.</p>
  
  <h2>How to generate waveform data on the server?</h2>
  
  <p>
    You can use the [audiowaveform](https://github.com/bbcrd/audiowaveform) program. For example:
    
<pre><code>audiowaveform -i some-file.mp3 --pixels-per-second 10 -b 8 -o some-file.json</code></pre>
