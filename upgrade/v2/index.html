  <h1>Upgrading from wavesurfer.js version 1.x to 2.x</h1>
  <p>Wavesurfer.js version 2.x introduced dependency injection and a dynamic plugin API. This became necessary to fully support module bundlers like webpack or browserify. (Before version 2 wavesurfer relied on a global library object)</p>
  <p>Apart from this architectural change there have been a number of smaller <a href="/upgrade/v2/changes.html">changes</a> and refactors:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The codebase now uses modern ES2015 language features.</li>
    <li>Webpack/Babel has replaced grunt as build system</li>
    <li>The multicanvas renderer is now the default, the monocanvas renderer has been removed to keep the library size small.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Status</h2>
  <p>Version 2 is stable and released. Due to the nature of the refactor (an integrated plugin system for adding, initialising and destroying of plugin instances) all plugins are somehow affected.</p>
  <p>Conventional use cases (i.e. cases where you just want to create an instance with some plugins – no dynamic adding or removing) should work just fine.</p>
  <h2>Developing</h2>
  <p><code>npm install</code> and then <code>npm start</code> – The library directory is exposed under http://localhost:8080</p>
  <p>Generate the documention by running <code>npm run doc</code> – Tests can be run by calling <code>npm run test</code></p>
